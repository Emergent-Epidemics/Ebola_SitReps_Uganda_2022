# Uganda Ebola SitReps
We are digitizing the daily SitReps from the Ebola outbreak in Uganda [here](https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879).

It's critical to point out that we haven't yet performed proper validation on these data and would very much welcome contributors who are either interested in suggesting code changes, validating data, and/or contributing new data sets. In addition, please see the specific license, warranty, and copyright information for our code and each individual data set.

## Information on data files and use
1. As of Oct 27th, SitReps 1 - 9 are missing, so data start on Sept 29th, 2022, and SitRep 11 is missing.
2. SitReps 10 - 18 only contain country-wide data.
3. Regional information on cases begins for SitRep 19, which means that SitRep 20 is the first where line list cases can be disaggregated by region. That is Oct 9th, 2022.
4. Data were hand curated prior to SitRep 20.
5. Ebola_SitReps_Uganda_2022/Data/CSVs/Ebola SitReps Uganda Baseline.csv contains the hand-curated line-list through SitRep 20.
